## Time-Zone and Coordinate-Frame converter.

This tool provides a nice interface to convert between time-zones and coordinate-frames without internet access.

Coordinate frames supported:
    
    Geographic  (TODO)
    ECEF        (TODO)
    ECI         (TODO)
    ENU         (TODO)
    NED         (TODO)
    LUF         (TODO)
    
You are also able to edit the timezones (Add & Remove) in the database through the settings.

### **Do not forget to change the amount of leap seconds through the settings.**
